# Smart Home Remote Controller

We are building a smart home remote system.

The remote can control:
- Light
- Fan
- TV

Requirements:
1. Remote buttons should not directly depend on device classes.
2. We must support undo.
3. New devices should be added without modifying remote code.

## Files

- **bad-code.ts**: The messy version. Do **not** use this one.  
- **better-code.ts**: The clean and proper version. Use this one :)
