# Notification system

You are building a notification system for a web application. 

There are multiple types of notifications: 

`EmailNotification`, 

`SMSNotification`, 

`PushNotification`.

Each notification has a message and recipient.

Your task is to send each notification using the correct method:

1. EmailNotification → send via email

2. MSNotification → send via SMS

3. PushNotification → send via push service
