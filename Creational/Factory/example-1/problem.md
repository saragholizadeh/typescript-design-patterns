# Exercise: Logistics System

## Scenario
Imagine you are building a **logistics system**. The program should support multiple transport methods:

- 🚚 Truck  
- ✈️ Airplane  
- 🚢 Ship  

Each vehicle has its **own specific method** for transport.  
When adding a new transport method, the **core program should not change**.  

## Files

- **bad-code.ts**: The messy version. Do **not** use this one.  
- **better-code.ts**: The clean and proper version. Use this one!
