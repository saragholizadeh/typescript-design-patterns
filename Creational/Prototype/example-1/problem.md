# Example: Notification

### Scenario
 
We have a notification system (Email / SMS / Push).

Each notification has:

- title

- message

- priority

- channel

- sender

Creating them repeatedly from scratch causes duplication and messy code

We need preconfigured templates and clone them.

## Files

- **bad-code.ts**: The messy version. Do **not** use this one.  
- **better-code.ts**: The clean and proper version. Use this one :)
