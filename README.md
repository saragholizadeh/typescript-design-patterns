# Learn Design Patterns in Typecript

Even though I’ve been coding as a backend developer for 3 years and know design patterns, sometimes I **don’t know exactly where or how to use them**.  
That’s why I’m reading this book: [Dive Into DESIGN PATTERNS](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book) and I created this project, that is my personal playground for **learning and practicing design patterns** using TypeScript.  

I want to **understand where and how to use them in real-world scenarios**, and at the same time **share these examples** to help others learn too :)


## Project Structure

Each folder represents a type of design pattern. Since we have three traditional categories of design patterns —**Behavioral, Creational, and Structural** — each category contains subfolders for individual patterns.

Inside each pattern folder, you’ll find example folders. Each example folder contains three files:

1. **scenario.md** – a task or scenario given to you.

2. **bad-code** – a working but “dirty” version of the code. It usually relies on a few if/else statements. Although it may look shorter, it has some problems, which are explained at the end of the file.

3. **better-code** – a cleaner, more flexible version. It may seem a bit more complex at first, but trust me — read it carefully and try to understand it. It shows a better approach to keeping your code clean and scalable.

## Feedback Welcome

If any problem description or solution is unclear, or you have suggestions to improve the examples, please let me know..

**You can also add more practical examples and scenarios or even problems that you had and you solved using a design pattern**

Your feedback will make this learning resource better for everyone :)
