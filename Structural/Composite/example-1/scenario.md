# Project Management system

### Scenario

You are building a Project Management system.

There are two types of tasks: 
    - SimpleTask 
    - CompositeTask (a group of tasks).

You need to implement a TaskService that calculates the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks for a project.

- **better-code.ts**: The clean and proper version. Use this one :)
