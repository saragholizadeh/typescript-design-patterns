# Desktop icon system

### Scenario

You are asked to build a desktop icon system.

    - Each icon has a type (folder, file, shortcut), a color, and a symbol.
    - Each icon has a position (x, y) on the screen.
    - Many icons share the same type, color, and symbol, but positions are unique.

**Implement a way to draw all icons using shared objects for repeated data**


## Files

- **bad-code.ts**: The messy version. Do **not** use this one.  
- **better-code.ts**: The clean and proper version. Use this one :)
