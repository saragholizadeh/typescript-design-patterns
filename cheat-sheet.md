### 🧠 Design Patterns Cheat Sheet (Mental Version)

This is like a cheat sheet for remembering each pattern's usage:

### Strategy

One action, multiple behaviors. Choose behavior at runtime - behavior changes

### Builder

Complex object? Build it step by step. - construction is complex

### Factory

Don’t ask “how”, ask “which object?” - object type decision

### Singleton

One instance, shared everywhere. - single shared instance
